# Empowering-Local-VM-Deployment-with-Automation

üõ†Ô∏è The Challenge üõ†Ô∏è
Facing the age-old problem of manual VM deployment. It was time-consuming, error-prone, and just not scalable for growing needs. Nneeded a solution to expedite the process while maintaining the high quality I expected.

ü§ñ The Solution ü§ñ
Enter automation! Decided to revamp the VM deployment process from the ground up, and here's what:

1. Vagrant: Vagrant for its simplicity and flexibility. It allowed to define my VM configurations in code, ensuring reproducibility across environments.

2. Shell Scripting: To fine-tune the provisioning process, Used shell scripts. This gave complete control over software installation, configuration, and other customizations.

3. Git: Version control was key to the codebase. Git allowed to track changes, maintain a history of scripts and configurations.

4. Oracle VirtualBox: Used VirtualBox as a virtualization platform, providing a stable and scalable environment for VM instances.

5. Nginx: For load balancing, Implemented Nginx. It efficiently distributed traffic across VMs, ensuring high availability and reliability.

6. Apache Tomcat: Application server of choice was Apache Tomcat, which hosted Java-based applications with ease.

7. Java JDBC: Applications relied on Java JDBC for database connectivity, ensuring fast and secure communication with the database.

8. MariaDB (MySQL): Opted for MariaDB (RDBMS) as my database solution. Its performance and reliability met stringent requirements.

9. Memcached: To boost database performance, Used Memcached for caching, reducing query times and enhancing overall system responsiveness.

üéâ The Outcome üéâ
The results were astounding:
‚úÖ VM deployment time reduced by 80%

‚úÖ Zero manual errors in the deployment process

‚úÖ Improved scalability to handle increased demand

‚úÖ High availability and reliability, exceeding expectations

‚úÖ Streamlined version control and progress tracking through Git

üéâTechnical flow:

1. User Access through Load Balancing (Nginx):
Users access your application using the IP address of the Nginx load balancer. Nginx acts as the entry point for all incoming requests.

2. Routing Requests Based on URL:
Nginx is configured to route incoming requests based on the URL. This configuration is typically defined in Nginx's server block or location block.
Different URLs are mapped to specific backend servers (application servers) based on your routing logic. For example:
/login routes to the login functionality.
/logout routes to the logout functionality.
/add-user routes to the functionality for adding user details.
/data-management routes to data management functionality.

3. Handling User Requests by Application Server (Apache Tomcat):
Nginx forwards the user requests to the appropriate Apache Tomcat application server based on the URL routing.
Apache Tomcat is responsible for handling the web requests and processing them according to the specific functionality requested.

4. User Actions and Functionality:
Depending on the URL route and user actions, the application server performs various tasks:
Login: Handles user authentication and authorization, providing access to the appropriate resources.
Logout: Logs the user out of the system, terminating their session.
Adding User Details: Manages user data, validating and storing user information in the system.
Data Management: Performs actions related to data management, such as retrieving, updating, or deleting data.

5. Data Storage in MariaDB (MySQL):
The application server interacts with MariaDB to store and retrieve data as needed.
Data related to user details, sessions, and any other application-specific data is stored in the MariaDB database.
MariaDB ensures data integrity, security, and availability.

6. Response to User:
After processing the user request and interacting with the database as necessary, the application server generates a response.
This response is sent back through Nginx to the user who initiated the request.

7. Load Balancer Scaling:
As traffic grows, you can scale your system horizontally by adding more application server instances behind the Nginx load balancer.
Nginx will distribute incoming requests evenly among the available application servers, ensuring high availability and load balancing.
